# Build the code (a simple "make" at the command line works, and requires the PGI compiler to be loaded)

make

# Use Nsight Systems to profile the code at the command line and collect a timeline

nsys profile --stats=true -o miniWeather1 ./miniWeather

# TASK 1: where does Nsight Systems tell us we are spending all of our time?
# To answer this question, you can either look at the stdout from the above
# profiling session, or you can load the generated file, miniWeather1.nsys-rep,
# into the Nsight Systems UI. Once you've determined what the most important
# bottleneck is, modify the application driver to make this problem more
# appropriate for the GPU (hint: is there a way we can amortize out the cost
# of the most expensive step by making the application run longer?).

# If you're stuck, you can see the solution with

git apply SOLUTION1.patch
