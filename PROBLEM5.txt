# Profile the code again using Nsight Compute. What kernel is now
# the most expensive? Use the CLI to collect a profile
# of that kernel, and then analyze it in the Nsight Compute UI
# after scp'ing the generated file (miniWeather5.ncu-rep) to your local system.

ncu -f -o miniWeather5 --set full -k regex:.*set_halo_values_z.* -c 1 -s 10 ./miniWeather

# TASK 5: what does Nsight Compute tell us is the fundamental
# problem with this loop? Make a simple change to the OpenACC
# parallel loop directive to avoid this issue and improve the
# performance of the loop. (Hint: compare to set_halo_values_x).
# Using the Nsight Systems CLI, verify after making the change
# that this kernel is no longer the most expensive.

# If you're stuck, you can see the solution with
